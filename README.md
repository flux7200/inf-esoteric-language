    This language is named "INF," which is short for "INFINITY." There is a reason for the name.
The instructions of the language consist of "I," "N," and "F." Sound familiar? The instruction "I" increments a pointer.
The instruction "N" decrements a pointer. The instruction "F" executes the instruction associated with the pointer.
With this format, you can theoretically have an infinite amount of instructions.
This is why the language's name is short for, "INFINITY."

    Obviously, the language being only 3 visible instructions will make it unreadable. This is why I'm adding comments to
the language. Make sure that, while making an "INF" program, you add comments so that you can fix bugs later on.
I'n hoping this should be able to help make the language more usable for anybody who wants to use it. In order to add a
comment, type a "%" and then write what you want to comment. Goto the next line when you are done with the comment.
A comment should look similar to this: "% Hello, world!"

    I'm hoping that, using the infinite capabilites of this language, I can make it one of the most powerful esoteric
languages to exist. The first ever implementation I will make will be in Python. Afterward, I will make the language in Java,
or maybe even C. The code for every release will always be available online. I'm hoping to add the following things at
some point within the development process, and if not, then even more.

Arithmetic
Networking
Static Memory
Dynamic Memory
If Statements & Loops
File Management
OpenGL Support
